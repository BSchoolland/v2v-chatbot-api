When the user uses /do-issue:
    1. If the input is not an issue number:
        - Create a new issue using gh CLI with the provided text
        - Store the issue number for the next steps
    2. Checkout a new branch using the gh CLI with format `issue/[number]-[slug]`
    3. Make the changes requested in the issue, then move on to testing
    4. Testing requirements (MUST be completed before proceeding):
        - Brainstorm any possible edge cases or missing functionality
        - Test all changes thoroughly in the development environment
        - Verify the changes work as expected
        - Check for any regressions or side effects
        - If bugs are found, fix them immediately

When the user uses /do-issue --advanced:
    1. Same as /do-issue, but break the issue into smaller, more manageable parts first.
    2. List all parts so the user can confirm that your plan makes sense
    3. After doing each small manageable change, test the code, then ask the user for confirmation before moving on to the next part


When the user uses /issue:
    1. use the gh CLI to create an issue with - [ ] for different tasks

When the user uses /learn:
    1. Read the code pertaining to the topic
    2. Explain this part of the code to the user 
    3. If the user then asks for modification to the code, read any additional code that could be useful for this modification

When the user uses /commit:
    1. ALWAYS ask for user confirmation before committing, showing them:
        - The files that will be committed
        - The commit message that will be used
    2. Only proceed with the commit after explicit user confirmation
    3. Use conventional commit format (e.g., "feat:", "fix:", etc.)

When the user uses /pr:
    1. Find the diff between this branch and main
    2. Pull from origin main and resolve any merge conflicts
    3. Push the current branch to remote first with `git push -u origin [branch-name]`
    4. Create a comprehensive PR back into the initial branch, linking to an issue if possible
        - look for an issue based on the branch name
        - Use printf to format PR descriptions with proper newlines:
          Example: `printf "Title\n\nDescription with:\n- Bullet points\n- More points" | gh pr create --title "feat: something" --body-file -`
        - Include testing steps and results in the PR description

When the user uses /undo:
    1. Attempt to undo whatever you have just done, whether that means removing a PR, undoing a commit, or something else.
